## Advice
- Use `std::string` to own character sequences.
- Prefer `string` operations to C-style string functions.
- Return strings by value, rely on move semantics and copy elision.
- Use `at()` rather  than *iterators or []* when you want range checking.
- Use *iterators or []* rather than `at() `when you want to optimize for speed.
- Use a range-for to safely minimize range checking.
- `string` input doesn't overlfow.
- Use `stringstream` or a generic value extracition function (such as to<X>) for numeric conversion of strings.
- Use `string_view` as an argument of functions that needs to read character sequences stored in various ways.
  - `string_view` does not own the characters. It can be thought of as a pointer with a length.
- Use `?` to make patterns lazy.
